Fimfic-JSON-parser
==================
Written in JAVA

To work with this Parser you will need to download a "Simple JSON" library which can be obtained here:
https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/downloads/detail?name=json-simple-1.1.1.jar&can=2&q=

You will also need the 183 MB index.JSON file which comes from downloading the entirety of the fimfiction archive:

You are going to run out of heap space so follow these directions if you are using Eclipse:
